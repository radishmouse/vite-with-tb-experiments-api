Shows an example of building a Thunderbird add-on:
* with Vue/Vite and TypeScript
* that uses [one of the Experiments APIs](https://github.com/thunderbird/webext-support/tree/master/experiments/FileSystem)


## Dev Notes

* The code will only run in Thunderbird (v128+)
* The build scripts rely on [entr](https://github.com/eradman/entr).
